Visualing some data created running a union find algorithm on randomly generated matrices with "clusters" of connected nodes

Trying to recreate this https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~fricke/projects/hoshenkopelman/hoshenkopelman.html in Python

Used Matplotlib for the graph

The union find algorithm was modified from Stefan Pochmann's solution for this [leetcode question](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/discuss/77625/Short-Union-Find-in-Python-Ruby-C%2B%2B)

##Todo
*Experiment with different parameters such as a matrix/graph with 6 neighbors as opposed to 4
